# MIMIC
This is a repository to help track issues and progress on the MIMIC IV to OMOP ETL process

It contains an abbreviated version of the MIMIC ETL and Extract processes. All SQL logic is available and could be 
executed manually against a Databricks instance, but the python code is not executable in this form without 
an array of helper functions.
